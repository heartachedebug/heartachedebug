-  Hi, I’m Neo!!!! I've always been interested in tecnology since I was very young, so I decided to base my studies and career in that! :D
-  I’m interested in cybersecurity and programming in general! Also gaming (especially rhythm and multiplayer games) and art!
-  I currently know the basics of C and C# :) 
-  Pronouns: I use any pronouns (ele/ela em português). If you're unsure though, using they/them is ok!
-  Fun fact: I love the j-core scene! Especially t+pazolite. If you have any album/song recommendations, feel free to reach out!!
